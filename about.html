                        <p>
                            I am a builder, storyteller, startup founder, and professional dot-connector who believes
                            curiosity is a competitive advantage. I spend my days (and far too many nights) at the
                            intersection of innovation, community, technology, and "what if?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>JeffyMakesItFun (JMIF)</strong> is where I explore those intersections out loud -
                            sometimes thoughtfully, sometimes playfully, always honestly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're into innovation with personality, civic pride without fluff, and ideas that
                            don't take themselves <em>too</em> seriously, you're in the right place.

                            I've always been obsessed with how ideas move - from spark to <em>thing that actually
                            exists in the world</em>.

                            Illinois - <strong>especially</strong> Greater Peoria - has building in our lifeblood.
                            The region is full of dreamers, doers, and deliverers. We've just been historically bad
                            at telling our own story. This right here - it's my little nudge in changing that.

                        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                        <p>I am motivated by a few core beliefs:</p>
                        <ul class="passion-list">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Innovation isn't Just for Silicon Valley</strong> | Big ideas belong
                                everywhere - especially in the Midwest
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Technology Should Feel Human</strong> | If it's powerful but soulless,
                                we're doing it wrong.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Community is the Ultimate Force Multiplier</strong> | Cool things happen
                                way faster when people actually take the time to talk to each other.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fun is Not the Opposite of Serious</strong> | Fun is how serious ideas
                                survive long enough to matter.
                            </li>

                            JMIF exists to explore all of this and more - without pretending everything is

                            This site is part idea lab, part public notebook, part storytelling engine. Some posts
                            are going to be polished. Some are experiments. All of them... honest.
